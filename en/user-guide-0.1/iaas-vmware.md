Roboconf has a IaaS implementation for VMWare.  
It only supports the creation of *compute* VMs.

> VMWare support depends on your version.  
> What will most likely happens is that Roboconf will have several VMWare extensions, one per VMWare version.

Sample **iaas.properties**.  
Just copy / paste and edit.

```properties
# Configuration file for VMWare
iaas.type = vmware

# REST URL
vmware.url = 

# Credentials to connect
vmware.user	= 
vmware.password	= 
vmware.ignorecert = true

# Cluster information
vmware.datacenter = 
vmware.cluster = 
vmware.vmuser = 
vmware.vmpassword = 

# VM configuration
vmware.template =  
```
