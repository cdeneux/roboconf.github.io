Roboconf will soon have a IaaS implementation for Microsoft Azure.  
It only supports the creation of *compute* VMs.

> This page will be updated as soon as this implementation is completed.

Sample **iaas.properties**.  
Just copy / paste and edit.

``` properties
# Configuration file for Azure
iaas.type = azure 
```
