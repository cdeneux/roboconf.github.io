Do you need help? Do you have a question?  
Or maybe you simply want to discuss or exchange ideas about this project?

We are still wondering whether it is relevant or not to create a mailing-list.  
Anyway, you can use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/roboconf/roboconf/issues) to ask questions or start a discussion.

You will need a GitHub account for this (registration is free).
