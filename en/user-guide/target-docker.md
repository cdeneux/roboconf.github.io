Roboconf has a target implementation for Docker.  
From the Roboconf perspective, Docker is seen as a kind of IaaS.
Roboconf may create and manage docker containers, that run Roboconf agents (just like VMs) and can be used as deployment targets.

To install it, open the DM's interactive mode and type in...

```properties
# Here in version 0.3
bundle:install mvn:net.roboconf/roboconf-target-docker/0.3
bundle:start <bundle-id>
```

Sample **target.properties**.  
Just copy / paste and edit.

```properties
# Configuration file for Docker
target.id = docker

docker.endpoint = http://localhost:4243
docker.image = 0f3087570887
docker.user = guest
docker.password = guest
```

Here is a complete description of the parameters for Docker.

| Property | Description | Default | Mandatory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| target.id | Determines the target handler to use. | none, must be "docker" | yes |
| docker.endpoint | The end-point URL of Docker (requires Docker to be setup to use a TCP port). | http://localhost:4243 | no |
| docker.image | The ID or tag (name) of the docker image used as a template for the VM (as shown by "docker images", for example). If the image is not found, Roboconf will try to generate one, using "\<docker.image\>:\<docker.image\>" as its tag: if so, the "docker.agent.package" property is required so that Roboconf knows where to find the Roboconf agent to install on the generated image. | "generated.by.roboconf" | no |
| docker.user | The name of the user to connect. | none | no |
| docker.password | The password of the user to connect. | none | no |
| docker.email | The email of the user to connect. | none | no |
| docker.version | The Docker version (for API compatibility). | none | no |
| docker.agent.package | If you want this extension to generate a Docker image for you, this parameter is an **URL** that points to the ZIP or TAR.GZ file of a Roboconf agent distribution. The generated image is based on **Ubuntu**. | none | no |
| docker.agent.jre-packages | If you want this extension to generate a Docker image for you, this parameter indicates the JRE to install (as a system package), as well as other optional packages, separated by spaces. The package name(s) must be understandable by the apt package manager (Debian-based Linux distributions). | openjdk-7-jre-headless | no |
| docker.command.line | A command line to pass to the Docker container when it is created. | /usr/local/roboconf-agent/start.sh | no |
| docker.command.use | A boolean to indicate whether Roboconf should pass a command when it creates a new Docker container. Set it to **false** if you added a **CMD** instruction in your Dockerfile. | /usr/local/roboconf-agent/start.sh | true |

At least one of **docker.image** or **docker.agent.package** must be specified.

## Docker Configuration

See [Roboconf docker installation tips](docker-installation-tips.html) for details about installing and preparing docker for Roboconf.

## Prepare your own Docker image

> This is NOT necessary if the image is generated by Roboconf,  
> i.e. if **docker.agent.package** was specified in the **target.properties** file.

Start a Docker container using a docker system image (e.g. Ubuntu):

```tcl
docker run -v /tmp:/roboconf -t -i ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Note: the container started above shares the local **/tmp** as **/roboconf** under Docker (using the -v option).  
This can be useful to share files between the local file system and the Docker container (e.g. to install the Roboconf agent).

Let's assume you have copied the Roboconf agent in the shared **/roboconf** directory (here, the local **/tmp**).  
In the Docker container, execute the following commands.

```tcl
apt-get update
apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless
cd /usr/local
tar xvzf /roboconf/roboconf-karaf-dist-agent.tar.gz
ln -s roboconf-karaf-dist-agent/ roboconf-agent
```

Now, you have to add a **start.sh** executable script in the **/usr/local/roboconf-agent** directory.  
Set the following content (the script is mainly used to complete the agent setup at startup time).

```properties
#!/bin/bash"
# Startup script for a Roboconf agent on Docker
# Find the file containing the messaging configuration
msgConfigFile=$1

# Prepare configuration files
cd /usr/local/roboconf-agent
echo "# Agent configuration - DO NOT EDIT: Generated by Roboconf" > etc/net.roboconf.agent.configuration.cfg
echo "# Messaging configuration - DO NOT EDIT: Generated by Roboconf" > $msgConfigFile

# And update them
for p in \"$@\"
do
	if [[ $p == msg.* ]] ;
		echo ${p:4} >> $msgConfigFile
	else [[ $p == agent.* ]] ;
		echo ${p:6} >> etc/net.roboconf.agent.configuration.cfg
	fi
done

# Start Karaf
cd bin
./karaf
```

The container is now ready to become a Docker image.  
Outside docker, keep track of its ID, that will be useful to build the image.

- Use **docker ps** to obtain your container ID.
- Then, **docker commit -m "Roboconf-Agent-Image" \<your container ID\> roboconf-agent:some-tag**

Now, your image is created.  
Retrieve its image ID using **docker images**, and use it as *docker.image* in the Roboconf configuration (**target.properties**).


## Some Docker Tips

Here is a reminder of some Docker commands.

To list docker images:  
**docker images**

To remove a docker image:  
**docker rmi \<image-ID\>**

To run interactively a docker image (thus launching a container):  
**docker run -i -v /tmp:/roboconf -t \<image-ID\> /bin/bash**

Note: the -v option is used there to share the local "/tmp" as "/roboconf" in the container, which is useful to exchange files.

To list running docker containers:  
**docker ps** (or, to list them all, "docker ps -a")

to attach a shell script to a running container:  
**docker exec -ti \<container-ID\> /bin/bash**

To remove a docker container:  
**docker rm \<container-ID\>**

To remove all exited containers:  
**docker ps -a | grep Exit | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs docker rm**

## Note to install latest Docker (Ubuntu)

As of March 3, 2015 (docker 1.5.x)...

```tcl
$ wget -qO- https://get.docker.io/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo sh -c "echo deb http://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list"
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install lxc-docker
```
